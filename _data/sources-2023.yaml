  description: The current study explored the relationship between oxytocin, first-hand pain sensitivity, and pain empathy among healthy participants. Oxytocin lessened hyperalgesia to pressure pain due to repeated exposure to painful stimulation, which is indicative of oxytocin-induced attenuation of first-hand pain sensitivity.

  description: A plausible explanation for these findings is that testosterone acts to increase vigilance and sustained attention levels, as evidenced by the decreased Î±-oscillation power. Thus, our findings support a causal role for testosterone in heightening the biological salience of incoming somatosensory information.
