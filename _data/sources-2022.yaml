  description: Individual variation in pain sensitivity is related to an interpretation bias toward pain but not to a memory bias. The observed link between pain-sensitivity profiles and interpretation bias in healthy individuals suggests the potential role of interpretation bias in chronic pain development and maintenance. Intervention to reduce interpretation bias toward pain might be helpful in the prevention and treatment of chronic pain.
